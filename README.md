# Estimating food demand for supermarkets
This project was choosen to tackle the question of how (online) supermarkets can use data to reduce food waste.

## Motivation
I choose this project because every year supermarkets produce around 200.000 tonnes of food waste in (1). While they collect a lot of data they seem to not fully understand the potential of that data. Therefore I want to present a data evaluation that can already provide supermarkets and grocery delivery services with useful insights.

For this project the following data set provided by Instacart was used. https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/instacart-market-basket-analysis

Attached please find the presentation.
